<pre lang="tcl"> 
# tclify_core.tcl

#!/bin/env tclsh
# The shebang tells the system to use Tcl shell to run this script.

# ---------------------------------------------
# This script reads a .csv file and extracts initial design variables.
# These variables can be used for synthesis and timing flow.
# ---------------------------------------------

# Get the filename from the command-line arguments
# [lindex $argv 0] returns the first element (index 0) of the list $argv
set filename [lindex $argv 0]

# Load required Tcl packages
package require csv         ;# for parsing CSV files
package require struct      ;# provides data structures like matrix

# Create a matrix named 'm' to store CSV contents
::struct::matrix m

# Open the CSV file for reading
# 'open $filename' returns a file handle
set f [open $filename r]

# Read the CSV into the matrix 'm'
# '::csv::read2matrix $f m "," auto' reads CSV with ',' separator and stores in 'm'
::csv::read2matrix $f m "," auto

# Close the file after reading
close $f

# Get number of columns and rows
# 'm columns' returns number of columns in m
set columns [m columns]

# Link the matrix to an array called 'my_arr'
# Now we can use 'my_arr' to access matrix elements
m link my_arr

# 'm rows' returns total number of rows in the matrix
set num_of_rows [m rows]

# Initialize a counter variable
set i 0

# We can loop through each row of the matrix here if needed. 
# Here we extract key-value pairs for variables
while {$i < $num_of_rows} {
      puts "\nInfo: Setting $my_arr(0,$i) as '$my_arr(1,$i)'"     ;# Log variable name and value

      set i [expr {$i + 1}]                                       ;# Increment loop counter
}

# Print basic info for debugging
puts "\nInfo: Below are the list of initial variables and their values."

puts "Use 'puts <variable name>' command to query value of below variables"

# These variables are expected to be populated from the CSV or elsewhere in your flow.

puts "ConstraintsFile   = $ConstraintsFile"

# Exit the script
