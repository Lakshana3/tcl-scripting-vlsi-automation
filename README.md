# TCL & Linux Scripting for Semiconductor Design

## Overview
This repository contains course materials, lab exercises, and scripts from TCL VSD Workshop focused on mastering TCL scripting and Linux skills. 

The content is aimed at enabling automation in digital design flows by providing hands-on examples in TCL scripting, constraint handling, Yosys-based RTL synthesis, and Quality of Results (QOR) analysis.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Master TCL scripting fundamentals and advanced procedures
- Automate constraint file generation (CSV, SDC to OpenTimer)
- Integrate TCL with Yosys for RTL synthesis and memory module generation
- Perform hierarchical design checks and error detection
- Generate and analyze QOR metrics including WNS (Worst Negative Slack) and FEP (False Path)

## Curriculum
